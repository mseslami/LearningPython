# Sync: send request and get response  same time
# Async: send request but you should wait to get response ( just like snap) (when we have too much requests)
# Python is good for too big numbers
# Pep 8 : rules of python
# We assign value to a variable we don’t say they are equal
# Try to learn golang!
# Try katie programing problems
# Python has interpreter not any compiler (it compile line by line)
#
# We don't need to define type of a variable (int, string …)
#  a == b >> check just the value a is b >> check id   >> result is true or false
#
# Unmuteable objects are those which defien just one time and if we change the value, it make a new object and new id
#  5/2 = 2.5
# 5//2 = 2
# _*2 = 4 : _ means the before prosses
# Bin(8) = 1000
# B = a or c >> a =10 and c =0 >> b =10
# Not a  = true if a = false
# -5 or 0 >> result is -5 >>>>>> example : for age c =0, d =25 >> if c or d
#
# Don’t use temp! >>  a =3 , b=4, >>> a , b = b , a >>>>> b =3, a =4

# Tuple : "hi %s" % ("hi hi",)
# Index in a list start is 0>>>> s.length and if we start of end it's from -1 to -s.length-1
#
# A [ start: end : step]  if step is - >> result is the it's reverse
# Dir(a):…
# A.replace ("a" ,"b")
# None is same null it's an object
# If a =[] emptylist  use : (if not bool (a)): …
# Comment: multyline : """ or '''
# Str support persian but byte doesn’t
# A = b"salam" >>> a.encode("utf_8")>>>> a .decode("utf_8")  if we ant to save string it should be a byte not unicode
# Help(a.replace)
# Defult velue in a function: def a (a , b=10): …. count in the a.replace means: do it just one time >>>> -1 means every time
